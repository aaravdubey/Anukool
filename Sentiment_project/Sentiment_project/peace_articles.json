If this happens, embrace that too. Sometimes people think they should always have no thoughts, and they get stuck in resistance again.Also feel free to ignore what I've said if it doesn't resonate with you.\"Sometimes people can be holding up a measuring stick to assess \"how present\" they are being in the moment. But why? What is the point of being present anyway? Generally it is so that someone feels more at ease, or more aligned with their true mind, which is empowered rather than negative.A question you can ask yourself is: \"why am I trying to be present?\" The answer might be \"to feel free or at peace or at ease\". So, how would it feel if you were now free already? How would freedom feel? Sometimes this question can speed up your experience of freedom, if that is what you are seeking.

I'm really enjoying it. But dealing with my pain body is making me act in bizarre ways.Any advice you can give me would be much appreciated.Thank you.Hello,Hope you are well too.That's great that now you are noticing and taking it less seriously (or not giving it belief like you used to), it starts to stop immediately.Continue with the same approach and it will get easier and easier, and the pain energy will get weaker and weaker.Why heat? I can only guess that it is some form of resistance. Resistance in other forms (rubbing your hand against a desk, for example), will produce heat. I think it's just a form of resistance.I think that you are right - when you don't react, even more pain comes at first to try to drag you into a battle. Another way to look at it is old pain comes to the surface and is released. I think the way you are handling it is very effective. That's great you are enjoying your job. Let that be your main focus of your attention - the fact that you enjoy your job - and that will help diminish resistance without you directly trying.The only other thing I could suggest is to APPRECIATE moments of ease or calm. What you appreciate, appreciates, and your clarity will grow stronger by itself. This appreciation could be as simple as saying \"I love feeling calm and clear\", or \"I love feeling at ease\" - whenever you feel remotely calm or at ease.The more you notice and appreciate the calm moments - the stronger that energy grows in you, and it will make the pain energy even less believable if it ever returns.Focusing on or appreciating the good and calm moments really works wonders for dissolving background pain without any effort. One day you might be in a situation that was formally a trigger, and then you will notice that it no longer triggers your pain body anymore.Sounds like you are doing great.All the best,Adam"},{"Heading ":"The Secret Of Self Confidence","Context":"\u201cThe secret of self confidence isn't to stop caring about what people think - it's about caring about what YOU think.

What are they doing to help?","Content":"Hello everyone,\"Things wither and die through indifference. They are kept alive through attention.\" - Neville GoddardIf you are dealing with any negative thought patterns, question whether or not they are serving you. What are they doing to help?Often negative thought patterns can be assumed to be helping us on some level, but usually they aren't contributing to our wellbeing at all. In fact they are doing just the opposite.Habits of negative thought can often be like complaints to ourselves. There can be an assumption that the more we inwardly complain about something not being as we want it to be, the more likely we will be able to get what we want. This usually isn't very effective once the thoughts just start repeating themselves in the mind.Just noticing that negative thought patterns aren't serving to improve yourself or your life, can automatically mean you start to give them less importance. With less importance assigned to them, when you no longer assume they are helpful guides, their strength begins to diminish by itself.The same can be said for worry. If it is clearly seen that the thoughts of worry aren't helping you to produce a positive result, then naturally they start to weaken by themselves.Negative thoughts are never enemies, but once they take hold and just go on repeat in the mind - their value and usefulness should be questioned, and questioned with honest curiosity.Sometimes it can be surprising to discover that a certain way of thinking that you might have been living with for years, actually never helped you at all.I hope everyone has a good week.All the best,Adam OakleyInner Peace Now > Blog > How To Deal With Negative Thoughts"},{"Heading ":"How To Deal With Stress","Context":"Recently during a one-to-one session, someone asked me how to deal with stress. A technique came up that was quite effective, and I hope it can help anyone here who is dealing with anything similar\u2026","Content":"Recently during a one-to-one session, someone asked me how to deal with stress. A technique came up that was quite effective, and I hope it can help anyone here who is dealing with anything similar.The first thing to mention (which was not mentioned during the one-to-one) is that it often helps to just write out your feelings. Write down what you are stressed or worried about. Sometimes we keep worries in our minds because we are afraid of forgetting about something that we think needs to be fixed. If you put it down on paper, you can rest assured that it is always there to be looked at again if needed. If you have the intention of feeling better - writing down any stresses or worries gives you permission to let them go, at least for a while.During the one-to-one call, I said to the person:\u201cYou know how stress feels. Now what is the opposite of stress, for you?\u201cFeel for what the answer is in your body, as if you are asking the question within. Then see what the response is.\u201dI was expecting the person to give a word like \u201cease\u201d or \u201ccalm\u201d or \u201cjoy\u201d, but they didn\u2019t. They just smiled and said it was a certain sensation. And they could feel it.This person felt \u201cthe opposite of stress\u201d begin to grow in their system, and this lasted for about a minute.Then it stopped. Then the stress came back.So we repeated the process, in an easy, light way. \u201cI know how stress feels. So what is the opposite of stress?\u201dThis time it didn\u2019t work at all. The stress remained. The person told me they could no longer feel the \u201cwonderful state\u201d that they were beginning to feel before.Then I asked the question: \u201cHow would you feel if you could make the \u2018wonderful state\u2019 more important than the reasons to be stressed?\u201dThe person asked me to repeat this.\u201cHow would you feel if you could make the \u2018wonderful state\u2019 more important than the reasons to be stressed?\u201dThen we started to see some good results. Things started to shift.Stresses and worries tend to take precedent over any calm or relaxed state, because they are responses to perceived dangers. The painful thoughts think that they are helping to resolve a situation and keep us safe. But we all know that whenever there is a truly challenging situation that arises, the person who is clear and calm is able to function most fluidly and clearly using their instinct. Even if they feel fear or stress, it is the one who is not completely taken over by these feelings who usually responds best to stressful situations. They are not fighting against themselves or their feelings, so they just respond if needed.Therefore it is useful to see where our allegiance lies. Where our faith lies, where our loyalty lies. If you use the process above, even for ten minutes, during that ten minutes it is helpful to decide that you will be completely faithful and loyal to the \u2018wonderful state\u2019, the opposite of stress, as if it is your chosen partner and you are in a committed relationship with it. If you are disloyal and cheat on the relaxed or wonderful state, then you will be mixing with denser energies, having mental relationships with thoughts that don\u2019t actually serve you in the way they think they do in that moment.I\u2019m not saying you have to walk around in this state all the time. You don\u2019t have to do anything. But as a tool for relieving stress, if that is what you want, then I invite you to sit or lie down somewhere safe and comfortable, and go through the simple process above.

The same goes for negative thoughts. The discomfort of negative thoughts is a signal that they are not giving you any good advice, and it would be in your best interests not to take them seriously. They feel dark because they are thoughts that don\u2019t come from your natural powerful light, and usually they have come through some sort of conditioning.Negative thoughts never have to be fought against, but it does help to recognise that these energies are not effective givers of advice. Just like the negative friend, they think they are saying what is best, but really they are not helping at all. If anything, they are doing the opposite of helping.Once a painful thought is recognised as not a useful helper, it can be allowed to pass through, or it can be disregarded as false, and replaced by any affirmative or powerful thought of your choosing.To create space for more powerful, abundant or creative thoughts, it can help to first open yourself up to the broadest, freest part of yourself. Ask yourself a question like: \u201cIf I knew I was one with the universe around me, how would I feel?\u201d. This might help to create some space and take attention away from a mind that feels closed, small and cut-off from abundant power.I hope everyone has a great Christmas this year.

I have been focused on some other things, including a new book that might be out by Christmas (for kids and grown-ups), and I haven't felt like creating any new posts.But now, I feel like saying this:People I speak with during one-to-ones are often thrown off by negative thoughts. They might be in a good place mentally, but a particular painful thought might keep coming back to nag them.One of the best solutions is indifference.If the negative thought pattern returns, it usually feels like a big deal. We are used to reacting against pain, it is natural to do so, so when a negative thought arises it can feel as if it messing up our inner world.But what if you were indifferent to thoughts that didn't feel good? What if negative voices didn\u2019t mean anything to you? What if you were indifferent as to whether they were there or not?If you experiment with it, the indifference towards negative thoughts is quite powerful. It might not be an instant fix forever, but gradually, as negative thoughts come back and seem to want to cause a fuss, your lake of care towards them means they start to lose their disturbing power.Once they have arisen, you probably feel you can\u2019t make them un-arise. But with a lack of interest, a lack of importance given to them, a total indifference to whether they are there or not, you might start to find your balance, and more freedom if there is anything positive you are looking to focus on, even if you want your focus to be on the simple sense of \"I Am\", being, an affirmation, or even your breath.You might notice that using this approach means thoughts in your head start to soften, and you might be left with an underlying uncomfortable emotion in your body. Treat that discomfort in the same way. Be indifferent as to whether it is there or not. And if you really want to transmute it faster, surround it with the unconditional energy of \"thank you\" within yourself.Experiment with indifference to negative thoughts. Give it a day, and see what happens.All the best,Adam"},{"Heading ":"Having Emotional Goals For Finding Happiness","Context":"Having a goal helps to focus your mind and energy.

Even if they were doing something creative that they enjoyed, their mind would come in with negative thoughts of:\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be wasting your time with this. You should be doing something more valuable that is more likely to bring you money.\u201dThe result was that this person was discouraged in their activity, and when they stopped, they didn\u2019t do anything else constructive. That was it.A negative mind can of course come in all kinds of forms. It can appear as worrying about something, or being down on yourself about something.Negative thoughts tend to take hold on us because we subconsciously believe that they will help us in some way. Perhaps in our lives if we have been sad enough or upset enough, someone else has come and given us help, special attention, or changed their ways. For whatever reason, there is often an assumption in us that this negative voice in the head must in some way be valuable. Otherwise \u2013 why would it be there?We can unconsciously assume that perhaps the negative mind is helping us, keeping us safe, or keeping us disciplined or holding us accountable to mistakes we have made.But in the end, negativity tends to do one thing:Hold you back.So, instead of being in any kind of battle with a negative mind (as the person who I was speaking to was), instead you can try this:Ask the mind to ACTUALLY help you.It is as simple as stopping and saying: \u201cOk, mind, it seems you are trying to help me in some way with this kind of thinking. So help me then. ACTUALLY HELP ME. Help me with this subject. Help me to progress and move forward. Give me real help.\u201dThen wait, and see what happens. Remain in this state of receptivity, asking for and expecting help.It is almost as if you are calling the negative mind\u2019s bluff. It is a disruptive presence within you, acting as if it is helping, so you give it a chance to ACTUALLY HELP.During the one-to-one call with someone, when we did this, the first thought the person got was:\u201cFocus on things that you like.\u201dThis was a different thought to the ones that she had recently been having. It was far more wise and positive.I asked her to remain in that same state, saying \u201cOk, thank you, anything else?\u201dAfter a short while she began to receive other thoughts of herself in a much more pleasant state \u2013 relaxed, happy and less attached to negative thoughts. Considering that most of her recent thoughts were anxious ones, this was a step in the right direction.It can be as simple as this. To remain in this state. Actually following the wise advice that comes from within you is also of great benefit. What sometimes happens is someone receives some form of higher guidance, but soon enough they are back under the influence of a negative or fearful mind.The question the caller then asked me after seeing herself in a pleasant state, was:\u201cSo how do I get in that kind of state where I feel relaxed and happy?\u201dMy answer was:\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything differently. Remain in that same receptive state. Say \u2018thank you\u2019 for these pleasant visions of yourself, and then say: \u2018anything else?\u2019 This pleasant state that you can start to see will build momentum and enter your system more fully if you simply remain receptive to it. You don\u2019t have to \u201cdo\u201d it or create it as a personal task. It is already there. Remain receptive to it.\u201dAnd that\u2019s it.I hope that if you are dealing with a negative mind that pretends or believes it is helping you \u2013 you can actually surrender and ask it for real help, and see what happens. Either the negative mind will become quiet as it has nothing of value to actually say, or you begin to access the truest part of your mind that is indeed, actually helpful.I hope this little practice is useful for you.If anyone would like help finding more of their inner peace in any part of their lives, you can click here to book a session with me.

If someone has something that we want, but we think we don't have it, the jealous feeling can be an inner objection, like a child becoming upset if it doesn't get its own way, demanding that things change for the better.But the jealous feeling does not help to shift the universe to accommodate you further in your desire. It has the opposite effect. It closes down your energy and makes you shift towards an inner feeling of \"no\" towards success, love, riches or anything else that you want. It is essentially resistance towards what you actually want.The alternative approach is to re-train yourself to start to bless what you want when you see it. If someone is living in the conditions that you would like to live in, see if you can start to appreciate the abundance of it instead of condemning it in any way. This might seem difficult at first if jealousy has any past momentum for you, but it is easier if you take the approach of wanting to feel as good as you possibly can.Seeing someone get what they want in life can be met with a genuine feeling of \"Wow. That's great.\" If you actually like to see success in any form around you, if you start to appreciate it and love it, your energy starts to shift so that you are in alignment with it yourself.

You might find that the more you bless it with appreciation when you see it, the more you start to experience it for yourself.In a recent Group Zoom Meeting, someone asked about the feeling of jealousy in relationships - particularly to do with the jealousy she would feel if other women were approaching her partner.

The desire to feel good is a natural preference that leans in the direction of alignment and a sense of oneness with your own power, but negativity does not need to be resisted to go with it.Gradually as you end the war with yourself, as you stop fighting or condemning yourself or your feelings in any way, there can be a natural space that allows for the question:\u201cHow does happiness feel?\u201dThe less resistance there is in the mind, the easier it is for this question and its answer to be allowed. The mind can sometimes be quick to give you reasons to remain in tension or negativity or worry, and the above question can quickly feel uncomfortable. Treat it like a game. It can be a process.I will share more on this later. In a recent Zoom call someone shared that they were realising that it is okay to feel good, that there is nothing wrong with it. Then I shared a few thoughts which you can watch in a quick video below.If you would like to join the next group Zoom meeting, you are welcome\u2026Inner Peace Now > Finding Happiness > The Practicality Of Feeling Good"},{"Heading ":"How To Move Out Of Negative Self-Stories | How To Feel More Secure | How To Feel More Inner Peace","Context":"During a recent group Zoom meeting for inner peace, someone began asking about how to move out of negative self-stories.

You have the option to choose what you want without pushing against what you don't want. You have a natural preference for something that is in alignment with who you are.Often when people are experiencing negative emotions, there can be so much resistance and a sense of \"not being in control\", that the desire to feel better can create even more of a pushing against yourself and not allowing yourself to be as you are.At a certain point, if you are no longer judging or condemning yourself for feeling less than good, then gradually resistance begins to ease.\u00a0When there is less resistance, it is more easy to allow yourself to be tuned to a sense of well-being, wholeness, satisfaction or happiness, as if you are choosing, inviting, or making friends with that energy within you.Usually our natural desire for happiness becomes outweighed by our desire for other things. Feeling good is often taught as complacency or irresponsibility, as if you must put your inner well being\u00a0on hold before everything is as you want it to be.When the desire to be in alignment or to feel good becomes more important than everything else being perfect,\u00a0then it will begin to build a momentum of its own and become more and more pure. If it becomes consistent, it begins to influence your world for the better.If you would like to attend the next group Zoom meeting (you can just listen in if you don\u2019t want to participate), just fill out the form below\u2026Date: Sunday 25th AprilTime: 4pm UK Time \/ 11am Eastern \/ 10am Central \/ 8am PacificDuration: Approx 40 mins"},{"Heading ":"The Mantra Of \"Thank You\"","Context":"Try this little exercise of \u201cthank you\u201d to train your mind away from negative thoughts\u2026","Content":"Hello everyone,I enjoyed the Zoom call last week with those of you who attended. It was great to see you and to answer some of your questions.I will continue with the meetings at a similar time, but probably once every three weeks.Next week is Easter, so I will schedule the next meeting for 11th April. I will send out an invitation nearer the time, and rather than charging a set fee, I will include a donation link. Then if you want to support me and have some kind of exchange then that is great (with an amount that feels good to you, rather than an amount that you think you should give). But for those that don\u2019t want to donate, the meeting is still open to you.A key point from last week\u2019s meeting:A feeling of uneasiness or even a sense of doom around life is a defence mechanism conditioned by your past. It is like a crazy well-meaning friend who tries to convince you that if you remain focused on things you don\u2019t want, then you will have a better chance of avoiding them.Unfortunately the crazy friend doesn\u2019t realise that the more your energy is focused on unwanted things or a lack of what you want - the more effective you become at noticing and even attracting more of these things. Think of yourself as an energy being. Your energy affects your surroundings. If this is the case, the negative energy (even if it thinks it is helping you to protect yourself), actually keeps you stuck in an energy and a reality that you don\u2019t want to be in.Thank the crazy friend for trying, but realise there is a craziness to it. If you can go as far as to thank it for trying to help, the more easily it is to feel the vibration of \u201cthank you\u201d in your body.Try saying \u201cthank you\u201d for absolutely no reason and to no one, but within yourself, for just a few minutes.If you play that game, you will build a power of focus and begin to re-shift your energy to a place where negativity no longer likes to be. If it returns, it is weaker, and simply acts as a reminder that you are not fully aligned with who you are. It just signals that you are in fear instead of power.The crazy friend actually starts to become helpful \u2013 \u00a0he warns you when you are out of alignment, when you have strayed away from the natural good energy that is within you, that you may need to practice re-orientating yourself with.We are usually trained away from our own alignment and wellbeing. Our upbringing can be more about lack and fear than anything else, and so we start to think that these mental and emotional states are normal and necessary to survive. Start to play the game of re-orientation, the inner mantra of \u201cthank you\u201d for just a few minutes, until it builds its own momentum, and starts to take over the momentum of past painful thinking.Gradually the words of \u201cthank you\u201d become a feeling, and then the feeling is recognised as a frequency of energy or state of being that is very much in alignment with your natural positive power. It is much more orientated with a sense of abundance.Hopefully that can help for now.
